BM_WAR_OF_THE_RING_DESC;Middle-Earth, 1 Narwain 3019, the Third Age of this World. I amar prestar aen, The world is changed. Han mathon ne nen, I feel it in the water. Han mathon ne chae, I feel it in the earth.  A han noston ned 'wilith, I smell it in the air. Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it. These are dark times for Middle-Earth, large shadows spread in the East. Sauron, the Dark Lord, desperately looks for his Ring and is gathering all evil to him. Soon he will be ready to strike the Free Peoples. The kingdoms of Men are weak and in decline. Gondor seems to be the last realm with any chance of defending Middle-Earth. The Dwarves hide in the depths of their mountains, while the Elves flee to West. While Mordor prepares in the east, the traitor Saruman expands his domain into a weak Rohan, the Land of Horses. In these dark times the fates of all Middle-Earth lie with a single Hobbit, charged with a very dangerous mission.;Terre du Milieu, 1 Narwain 3019 du Tiers Âge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_KIN_STRIFE_DESC;Middle-Earth, 1 Narwain 1427, the Third Age of this world. The peaceful kingdom of Gondor is approaching a perilous time in it's history. Valacar, son of Romendacil II of Gondor, married a non-Numenorean wife. Despite her being daughter of the mighty King of Rhovanion, Vidugavia, most of the lords of Gondor think that her son, Eldacar, is not a true Numenorean, and so cannot be king. Civil war threatens to tear apart the great Southern kingdom of men. In Eriador, both Rhudaur and Cardolan have been defeated by Angmar, and Arthedain seems the only realm that can stop a full invasion of Eriador. Will you play as the Witch-King, and complete the conquest of the North? Or will you play as Araphor of Arthedain, and try to save the last remnants of the Kingdom of Arnor from darkness?;Terre du Milieu, 1 Narwain 1427 du Tiers Âge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_FALL_OF_ARNOR_DESC;Middle-Earth, 1 Narwain 1308, the Third Age of this world. This bookmark takes place roughly 1700 years before the events of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is a turbulent time for the successor kingdoms of Arnor, and the last light of the Dúnedain seems near to being extinguished. The three kingdoms of Arthedain, Cardolan and Rhudaur, split from Arnor upon the death Eärendur have had a relatively peaceful period, but this is set to change with the rise of the Witch-King of Angmar in the north. His strength is growing and soon he will be ready to strike at Rhudaur, the weakest of the three kingdoms and, if successful, perhaps begin to bring the age of the Dúnedain to a close.;Terre du Milieu, 1 Narwain 1308 du Tiers Age.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
